    Animation
------------------------------------------------------- 

This theme originally had animation built into it for various elements that you can apply CSS classes to them. However, this generally requires you to
go into files and modify them, so I decided to delete the animation CSS file to recommend a plugin called Animate It! to give you a lot more
flexibility without touching source code because this uses shortcodes.

For more info about plugins, see below... 

-------------------------------------------------------
    Recommended (Optional) Plugins for this Theme
------------------------------------------------------- 

* Animate It! - I recommend the Animate it! plugin which uses shortcodes
* Jetpack - Gives you several plugins rolled into one
* Simply Exclude - Allows you to exclude categories, posts, etc., from areas of your site
* Remove Widget Titles - Allows you to hide widget titles from the front-end

* How do I change Styles or Modify the Theme?

You have a couple options available, but 

1. Making "only" stylesheet (CSS) changes, you can use a plugin for editing CSS
2. To make CSS and/or modify the theme files, it's recommended to use a child theme so that you can keep your original theme up to date without losing your modifications/changes.
